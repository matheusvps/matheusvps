## 👋 About Me  
I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with over **4+ years of experience** building scalable, high-performance systems across **web, cloud, hardware-adjacent** and **computer-vision–enabled** environments.

I work across the full lifecycle — **architecture, development, optimization, and delivery** — with a strong focus on **clean code, system reliability, and maintainability**.

Experience in modern frontend, backend, infrastructure, automation, and low-level development. I especially enjoy solving complex problems and designing systems that have real-world impact.

Currently pursuing a **Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering (UTFPR)**.
